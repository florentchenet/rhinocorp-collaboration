# GitHub CLI (gh) Diagnosis Log

**Date:** 2025-12-04
**Command:** `gh repo rename`
**Version:** 2.83.1

## Issue
Attempts to rename `florentchenet/visual` to `rhinocorp-visualizer` failed with "accepts at most 1 arg(s), received 2".

## Diagnosis
Ran `gh repo rename --help`.

**Observed Usage:**
`gh repo rename [<new-name>] [flags]`

**Key Flag:**
`-R, --repo [HOST/]OWNER/REPO`: Select another repository using the [HOST/]OWNER/REPO format.

## Root Cause
The command `gh repo rename old new` is invalid. It interprets `old` as `<new-name>` and `new` as an extra argument.
The correct syntax for renaming a non-current repo is `gh repo rename -R old new`.

## Resolution
Execute: `gh repo rename -R florentchenet/visual rhinocorp-visualizer`
